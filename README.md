Python scripts to make predictions in Forest Trees from NorthAmerica. 
The code lines are provided 'as is' without any warranty of any kind.

Those are python codes were first tested in a jupyter notebook and then deployed on an HPC.
They were developped to predict an output from a set of genomic variables testing and optimizing four different algorithms, namely RandomForest, GBoost, KNN and linear regression.
